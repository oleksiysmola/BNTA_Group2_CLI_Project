# BNTA_Group2_CLI_Project
First group project completed during the Bright Network Technology Academy. This code recieved contributions from Darshil Dholakia, Aofie Sandy Boyle and Suraaj Leal through 
a combination of IntelliJ share and mob programming. The aim was to use Java to
create a simple command line interface that imitated the process of booking flights at an airport. Throughout we made use of the following Java concepts of:
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Scanners
- Classes and Methods
